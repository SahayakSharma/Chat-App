# Chat-App

This is a web chat application made using `react js` for front-end and `node js` for processing data in the backend. The application requires basic login credentials including first name and second name and an avatar for your porfile.
 
The web application uses `socket.io` library for secure connection between two or more clients. Using the library, message receiving and sending events are emitted and received onto different clients pages. 
## Project Architecture

The project follows a `monorepo` architecture to manage multiple related packages under a single repository. This allows us to organize and maintain various components, libraries, and modules efficiently. We use `Lerna`, a popular tool for managing JavaScript projects with multiple packages, to streamline our development workflow.

Lerna enables one to version packages independently, manage dependencies, and execute commands across packages seamlessly. This architecture promotes code reusability, simplifies dependency management, and enhances overall project scalability. Each package within the monorepo represents a distinct part of the project, contributing to a modular and maintainable codebase.

You can find the `client` and `server` folder inside the folder named `packages` and hence modify it.

# How it Appears

Here, you need to fill the given details includeing _first name_ , _second name_, _avatar_ to login successfully. After successfull login, the user is directed to the chatting screen where his/her `name` and `_avatar_` is displayed and the chats received and sent are displayed including the `_time_` at which they are sent or received.
